## Description

{/* Good ol' ChatGPT, not checked at all :) */}

The `LIMIT` command in SQL is used to specify the maximum number of records that the database should return in the result set of a query.
This command is very useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve only a portion of records for purposes such as pagination or when testing queries to avoid overwhelming the client application with too much data.
It is generally used at the end of a query after specifying the selection and sorting criteria.
