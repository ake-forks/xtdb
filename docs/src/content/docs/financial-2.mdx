The normal trading process goes something like this:

1. A trade is booked on a certain day
2. The same day, the trade is entered into the system

Like so:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO trades (xt$id, volume, of)
            VALUES
            (1, 150, 'ABC'),
            (2, 430, 'XYZ'),
            (3, 200, 'ABC')" />
  <Query q="SELECT t.xt$id, t.volume, t.of, t.xt$valid_from AS trade_date
            FROM trades AS t
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Sometimes a trade is booked right at the end of the day and isn't entered into the system until later:

Let's say this one was entered the next day:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-02"
       txs="INSERT INTO trades (xt$id, volume, of)
            VALUES
            (4, 320, 'DEF')" />
  <Query q="SELECT t.xt$id, t.volume, t.of, t.xt$valid_from AS trade_date
            FROM trades AS t
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

But oh dear, our reports for yesterday are missing the trade:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE t.xt$valid_from = DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Let's try that again. This time when the trade is entered late we can set the valid-time (business time) to yesterday, essentially backfilling the data:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-02"
       txs="INSERT INTO trades (xt$id, volume, of, xt$valid_from)
            VALUES
            (4, 320, 'DEF', DATE '2024-01-01')" />
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE t.xt$valid_from = DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Now our reports are working, great!

Can anyone see any potential problems with updating the past like this?

Let's say instead of backfilling a trade to yesterday, someone edits a trade from a *month* ago!

// TODO:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-02"
       txs="INSERT INTO trades (xt$id, volume, of, xt$valid_from)
            VALUES
            (4, 320, 'DEF', DATE '2024-01-01')" />
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE t.xt$valid_from = DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Now when the auditors come in, they check for changes in the last onth:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE t.xt$valid_from > DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

They can't find the edited trade! Has someone just gotten away with fraud?

If we want to allow editing the timeline, how can we avoid this?

In XTDB we use system-time (aka, wall clock time), an **immutable** timeline that gets added to with every change. In fact our malicious edit from earlier gets caught easily:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE t.xt$system_from > DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

In fact we can even check for suspicious changes, for example changes to valid-time more than 6 hours prior:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE (t.xt$system_from - t.xt$valid_from) > 0
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Conclusion: As an immutable database, XTDB keeps you safe from your own changes by making sure to record when they happened. Even when reaching into the past!
